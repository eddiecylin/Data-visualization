# data-visualization

This repository stores several data visualization projects I have completed. Each project folder contains original codes and dataset that could be used to reproduce the visualization.

[Compare Crime Frequencies across Different Districts in San Francisco](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-visualization/tree/master/crime_rates_in_san_%20francisco
)

[Fire Incidents in New York City & Average Firefighting Response Time across 5 Boroughs](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-visualization/tree/master/fire-incidents-new-york)
