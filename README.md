# data-visualization

This repository stores several data visualization projects I have completed. Each project folder contains original codes and dataset that could be used to reproduce the visualization.

[1. Compare Crime Frequencies across Different Districts in San Francisco](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-visualization/tree/master/crime_rates_in_san_%20francisco)

With crime data from offical sources, this project uses choropleth maps in Python to show the frequencies(density) of crimes in different districts in San Francisco. The types of crimes are not differentiated on the map and counted as a aggregate sum for each district.


[2. Fire Incidents in New York City & Average Firefighting Response Time across 5 Boroughs](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-visualization/tree/master/fire-incidents-new-york)

With offical data from FDNY, this projet uses R and plot to clean, wrangle, compute, and visualize data on NYC fire incidents across its 5 boroughs. The goal is to see if the average firefighting response time differs between different boroughs and if the distance between a fire incident and a firestation affects response time. 

[3. Corporate Income Tax Rates & Number of Fortune 500 Companies in Each State](https://github.com/eddiecylin/data-visualization/tree/master/fortune_500)

This project uses R and ggplot to scrape statistics data from webpages about population, corporate income tax, and number of Fortune 500 countries in each state (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). With geospatial data on those companies' locations, this project aims to see if corporate income tax rates, population, and other facotrs will affect where Fortune 500 companies set their headquarters in.
